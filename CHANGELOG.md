# Changelog

All notable changes to `@platform/paperclip-klipper` are recorded here. The
plugin follows semver against the host plugin API (PLA-526 keeps
`package.json.version` and the manifest version in lockstep via the build
`define`).

## 0.1.6 — 2026-05-27 (PLA-576)

### Changed
- `klipper.upload_gcode` tool now takes `{filename, artifactId, path?}` instead
  of `{filename, gcodeBase64, path?}`. The worker resolves the attachment
  through `runCtx.artifacts.fetch(artifactId)` (PLA-574 SDK bridge) and streams
  the bytes straight to `MoonrakerClient.uploadGcode` — callers never base64-
  encode the payload through tool arguments. This unblocks DPR-130's 14 MB
  G-code dispatch, which previously tripped the host's request-body cap
  (PLA-564 / PLA-573).
- `@paperclipai/plugin-sdk` + `@paperclipai/shared` bumped to the
  `2026.428.1-fork.9` tarballs that expose the `runCtx.artifacts.fetch` surface
  introduced in [PLA-574](../paperclipai/issues/PLA-574).

### Removed
- Dropped the `gcodeBase64` branch of the `klipper.upload_gcode` schema. There
  is no deprecated fallback — the worker rejects calls that omit `artifactId`
  with the schema-validation error the host emits for unknown / missing
  parameters.

### Notes
- The UI's `upload_gcode` action stub in `src/ui/UploadAffordance.tsx` is
  unaffected; rewiring the UI to upload as an artifact first is tracked
  separately as PLA-504.

### References
- [PLA-511](../paperclipai/issues/PLA-511) — original artifactId contract
  intent.
- [PLA-573](../paperclipai/issues/PLA-573) — release umbrella.
- [PLA-574](../paperclipai/issues/PLA-574) — SDK `runCtx.artifacts.fetch` +
  cross-tenant auth.

## 0.1.5 — 2026-05-23 (PLA-555)

- `package.json` declares `files: ["dist/", "README.md"]` so `npm pack` cannot
  silently drop the gitignored `dist/` artifacts. Added `postbuild`
  `check-manifest-version` to guard against version drift between
  `package.json` and the built manifest.

## 0.1.4 — internal

- (Skipped publish — version slot reserved during PLA-526 build-time inject
  rollout.)

## 0.1.3 — internal

- (Skipped publish — version slot reserved.)

## 0.1.2 — 2026-05-23 (PLA-514)

- Hand-roll `multipart/form-data` body + Content-Type header in
  `MoonrakerClient.uploadGcode`. The plugin-sdk `PluginHttpClient` stringifies
  non-string bodies (`String(body) === "[object FormData]"`) and never
  synthesizes a multipart Content-Type, so Moonraker returned
  `HTTP 500 ParseFailedException: Missing Content-Type header` until this
  workaround landed.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-05-23 (PLA-510)

- Aligned worker tool registration names + `klipper.upload_gcode` schema with
  the manifest (`{filename, gcodeBase64, path?}`). PLA-509 DPR found the
  worker had been registering bare tool names while the host dispatches by the
  namespaced manifest name.

## 0.1.0 — initial Phase-1 scaffold

- Manifest, RPC surface stubs, MoonrakerClient + page slot, permissive worker
  init (PLA-474 / PLA-475 / PLA-480 / PLA-502 / PLA-503 / PLA-505).
